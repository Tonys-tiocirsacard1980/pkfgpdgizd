Okay, so I just walked out from watching “Ad Vitam,” and man, I can't decide if my brain needs a nap or a really strong coffee. You know when a movie's got you tangled up in its weird chandelier of thoughts and feelings, and you’re like, What did I even just see? That’s me right now.

First off, imagine immortality is just something you can opt into, like signing up for a new cell phone plan. It’s all smooth until it's not. Seriously, how do you even process the concept of living forever without it turning into one of those bad infomercial ideas? Who asked for that level of existential migraine on a Monday night?

> And the visuals, oh boy. At times, it felt like they just raided a vintage thrift store on Mars: all neon lights and that particular shade of blue that makes you question your eyesight... or sanity. But it worked? Somehow? My eyes are still squinting, trying to adjust back to the regular human color palette, like, hello trees, sorry for taking you for granted.

Characters were a mixed bag—I vibed with the scruffy rebel ones because, let’s be real, every story needs those guys who look like they haven’t slept since 1894, and then there are the polished types who might as well be skincare influencers on the side. There’s something oddly comforting when the plot doesn't spoon-feed the answers, like the way my cat thinks he's helping by flopping on my keyboard mid-work.

```
// It's like someone threw this C/C++ gobbledygook into the movie just to mess with us:
int immortality(arg){
    return (life_span  0) + infinity;
}
```

Can we talk about the music? Half the time I couldn’t decide if my heartbeat matched the heavy bass or if the theater had a secret underground train rolling by. They definitely went hard on the vibes—if vibes translated into questionable dancing in the aisles.

Anyway, yeah, I might need to download the movie later to re-watch it—it’s one of those, you know? Watch the movie when you really want to question everything you've ever known about living and maybe drink a glass of wine or three. If nothing else, it’s a good excuse to avoid using my brain for anything important the next couple of days. Cheers to that, I guess.
